## TEAM DETAILS

TEAM ID: SW045


*Problem Statement* Bias and corruption among moderators lead to power imbalances and a "MOD IS GOD" scenario in an otherwise democratic setting.
                   Centralized moderation is susceptible to bias, whether unintentional or systematic, leading to uneven enforcement of guidelines.
                   

*Introduction to your problem statement and solution*
Mitigating cost to company on content moderation while ALSO shifting the moderation rights to the users of the platform. This will be done with the help of a decentralized system based on blockchain which will work as an extension to already existing social media apps.
